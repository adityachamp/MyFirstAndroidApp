# MyFirstAndroidApp
EC601
This is my first Android Application. I am using Android studio for the same. I have completed the basic tutorial and am now looking to modify the existing app. 
This App Basically consists of an empty text box and a send button wherein you enter data and on pressing the send button the information gets passed onto a different page and gets dislayed there.
A code snippet has also been added which helps in going back to the main page.
